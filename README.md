# DSA_SESSIONS
This repository will contain various DSA questions solved by me and my partner during our live sessions. 

Our first task was to select a dsa pattern of our choice, we started with the most basic,i.e., sorting

Our First DSA pattern is insertion sort
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting technique that builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It takes each element from the unsorted part and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted part.Out 
Step-by-Step Explanation:
Start with the second element (the first element is already considered sorted).
Pick the current element (called key) and compare it with elements in the sorted part on its left.
Shift elements that are greater than the key one position to the right.
Insert the key into the correct position in the sorted part.
